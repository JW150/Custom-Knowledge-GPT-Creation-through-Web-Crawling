# Custom-Knowledge-GPT-Creation-through-Web-Crawling
The project aims to develop a system that crawls content from one or more websites, processes the data into structured knowledge files, and uses that content to create a custom GPT model. The system will allow users to input URLs, from which the crawler will extract relevant text data such as articles, blog posts, or knowledge base entries. 

## usage
To start the main program:
`python main.py`
